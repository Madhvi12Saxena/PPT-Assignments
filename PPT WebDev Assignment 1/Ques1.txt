Q1:- <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

<!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag in HTML. It is called a Document Type Declaration or doctype declaration. It is used to define the version of HTML or XHTML being used in the web document.

The doctype declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag. It informs the web browser or parser about the markup language and version used in the document, which helps the browser to render the page correctly.

In the case of <!DOCTYPE html>, it is used to declare that the document is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML. HTML5 introduced new features, elements, and improved semantics compared to previous versions of HTML.

By including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, you ensure that the browser or parser treats the document as HTML5, enabling the use of HTML5 features and ensuring better cross-browser compatibility. It also helps the browser to enter the standards mode, which ensures consistent rendering of the page across different browsers.

In summary, <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag, but a doctype declaration that specifies the document type as HTML5. It is essential for the proper rendering and interpretation of the HTML document by web browsers.
