Q.6 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?

Ans:- Z Index (z-index) is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. 
Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index. 
Z index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).

z-index controls the stacking order of elements. 
Each element creates a separate stacking context. 
Elements with higher z-index values appear on top. 
Elements within the same stacking context are stacked based on their z-index values. 
z-index applies to elements with position values of relative, absolute, or fixed. 
The parent-child relationship affects the stacking order. 
z-index allows for the creation of visually dynamic layouts by layering elements.
