Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 

Ans:- The box model in CSS defines the structure and layout of elements on a web page. 
It consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. 
The content area holds the actual content of the element. 
The padding provides space between the content and the border. 
The border is a line that surrounds the padding and content. 
The margin is the space outside the border, creating separation between elements. 
Understanding the box model is essential for controlling the size and spacing of elements with CSS.
