Q.8 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

Ans:-Absolute Positioning: 
We can position an element exactly where you want, even if it overlaps other elements. 
It's like taking the element out of the normal flow and placing it wherever you specify.

 Relative Positioning: 
 We can move an element from its normal position a little bit, without affecting other elements. 
 It's like nudging the element around within the flow of the page. 
 
 Sticky Positioning: 
 You can make an element stick to a certain spot on the page when you scroll. 
 It's like a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning, where the element behaves differently at different scroll positions. 
 
 Fixed Positioning: 
 We can make an element stay in the same place on the screen, even when you scroll. 
 It's like sticking the element to a specific spot on the viewport, so it never moves.
