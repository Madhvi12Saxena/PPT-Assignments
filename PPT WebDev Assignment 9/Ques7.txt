Q.7 How do you handle conditional rendering in React?

Ans:-In React, conditional rendering is the process of rendering different content based on certain conditions or 
state values. There are several ways to handle conditional rendering in React, depending on the complexity of your 
conditions and the JSX elements you want to render. Here are some common approaches:

Using If-Else Statements:
You can use traditional if-else statements to conditionally render content in your components. 
For simple cases, this approach is straightforward and easy to understand.

Ternary Operator:
The ternary operator is a concise way to conditionally render content based on a condition.

Logical && Operator:
You can use the logical && operator to conditionally render content when the condition is true.

Conditional Rendering with Logical OR (||):
You can use the logical || operator to provide a default value when a certain condition is false.

Using Switch Statements:
For more complex conditional rendering, you can use a switch statement to handle different cases.

Rendering Components Conditionally:
You can conditionally render entire components based on certain conditions.
