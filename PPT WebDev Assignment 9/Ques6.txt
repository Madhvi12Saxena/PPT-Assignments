 Q.6 Explain the concept of React fragments and when you should use them.

 Ans:-In React, a fragment is a special component that allows you to group multiple children without adding an 
 additional DOM element. Fragments are used to avoid unnecessary wrappers in the component tree when you need 
 to return multiple elements from a component's render method.

The syntax for using React fragments is empty angle brackets, 
<>...</>, or the <React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment> syntax.

When to use React Fragments:

Grouping Elements: Use fragments when you want to return multiple elements from a component's render method without 
introducing additional wrappers.

Styling and Layout: Fragments are useful when you don't want to interfere with CSS styles or layout, especially if 
you need to add styles to the parent elements of the grouped components.

Returning Multiple Elements: If a component's render method needs to return multiple sibling elements (not wrapped 
inside a single container), using fragments is a clean and concise approach.

Map and Iteration: When using the map function to render a list of elements, fragments can help avoid unnecessary 
wrapper elements for each item in the list.
